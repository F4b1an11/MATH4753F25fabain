\title{Hypergeometric Simulation}
\usage{
myhyper(iter = 100, N = 20, r = 12, n = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{iter}{Number of simulation iterations to run. Default is 100.}

\item{N}{Total population size (number of marbles in the bag).}

\item{r}{Number of "success" items in the population
(e.g., number of white marbles).}

\item{n}{Sample size drawn without replacement from the population.}
}
\value{
A table of relative frequencies (proportions) for the number
  of successes observed across the \code{iter} simulations.
  A barplot of the distribution is also displayed.
}
\description{
Simulates repeated draws from a hypergeometric distribution by
sampling without replacement from a finite population.
}
\examples{
# Run 100 simulations of drawing 5 marbles from a bag with
# 12 white marbles (successes) and 8 black marbles (failures)
myhyper(iter = 100, N = 20, r = 12, n = 5)

# Larger simulation with 1000 iterations and sample size 19
myhyper(iter = 1000, N = 20, r = 12, n = 19)

# Compare to theoretical hypergeometric probabilities
dhyper(x = 0:19, m = 12, n = 8, k = 19)
